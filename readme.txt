# Big Data Analytics Course Project

This repository contains the replication of the paper: "A Proactive Intelligent Decision Support System for Predicting the Popularity of Online News"**

The goal of this project is to reproduce the predictive and optimization framework proposed in the original study.  
The work includes:
- Prediction Module: Evaluation of five machine learning models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes) using a rolling window scheme.
- Feature Importance Analysis: Identification of the most influential attributes for popularity prediction.
- Optimization Module: Application of a stochastic hill-climbing strategy to improve article popularity through editable features.

Repository Contents
- main.ipynb: Notebook with the full implementation.
- BigDataAnalytics_Report.pdf: Detailed report describing methodology, results, and comparison with the original paper.
- original_paper.pdf: The reference paper used for replication.
